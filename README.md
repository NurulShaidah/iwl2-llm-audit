üîç IWL2 Team Project: Smart Contract Vulnerability Auditing using LLMs
This repository contains the code deliverables and notebooks for our IWL2 team project, focused on auditing Solidity smart contracts for vulnerabilities using Large Language Models (LLMs).




üìÅ Project Structure
Gemini_Audit.ipynb
Colab notebook that uses Gemini LLM to audit smart contracts based on CVE data and CFG analysis.

OpenAI_Audit.ipynb
Colab notebook that uses OpenAI GPT-4 to audit smart contracts with the same configuration and logic as the Gemini pipeline.

Comparison_and_Graphs.ipynb
Notebook comparing the outputs from both LLMs, including accuracy, precision, recall, and severity plots.

cve_data.json
CVE dataset containing known smart contract vulnerabilities with relevant metadata and code samples.

ContractBenchmark.csv
Benchmark dataset used to compare LLM audit results against ground truth.

TrainingContracts.json 
Contains training examples used in Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) prompts.





üìå How to Use
Open each Colab notebook from the links below or from the repo.

Follow the cell execution steps inside each notebook.

Ensure the necessary files (e.g., CVE data, benchmark CSV) are uploaded in the Colab environment before running.
